# AnkiDoraemonVol1
An Anki deck for vocabulary from the Doraemon manga, volume 1.

I created this deck while reading through the original Japanese version of the Doraemon manga for the first time. Because this deck was created for personal use, I did not include words/phrases that are already easy for me to recall. It is best used by Intermediate-level Japanese students.

You can download the Anki desktop application at https://apps.ankiweb.net. The Doraemon vol. 1 manga is available for ~$5 on Amazon Japan (both physical and Kindle versions) at https://www.amazon.co.jp/ドラえもん（１）-てんとう虫コミックス-藤子・Ｆ・不二雄-ebook/dp/B0114L5LLG/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&dchild=1&keywords=ドラえもん第１巻&qid=1598319607&sr=8-4.

Happy learning!
