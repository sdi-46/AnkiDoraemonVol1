# AnkiDoraemonVol1
An Anki deck for vocabulary from the Doraemon manga, volume 1. Use this Anki deck to familiarize yourself with the vocabulary used in the Doraemon manga, to make your reading experience more fluid and interesting!

I created this deck while reading through the original Japanese version of the Doraemon manga for the first time. Because this deck was created for personal use, I did not include words/phrases that are already easy for me to recall. There is no romaji, and in most cases, the dictionary form of a verb is used in the deck, regardless of its use in context in the manga. This deck is best for use by Intermediate-level Japanese students.

You can download the Anki desktop application at https://apps.ankiweb.net. The Doraemon vol. 1 manga is available for ~$5 on Amazon Japan (both physical and Kindle versions) at https://www.amazon.co.jp/ドラえもん（１）-てんとう虫コミックス-藤子・Ｆ・不二雄-ebook/dp/B0114L5LLG/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&dchild=1&keywords=ドラえもん第１巻&qid=1598319607&sr=8-4.

If you have Anki already installed on your desktop, you should be able to open this deck as an Anki package directly from your Downloads.

Happy learning!
